# MeterClicker

I made this program mostly as a joke. During my internship at Honeywell, I worked on writing test scripts in Python and Visual Basic 6 to test the functionality of electric power meters. I found an image on google of one of the products that I worked on and so I made a game that has a click me button that appears on a random meter. Whenever you click on that button, another appears on a different random meter.

It's simple but fun...
